This repo provides build files to compile the libs used by the EasyRPG project
for Visual Studio easily.

Requirements
============

Any version of Visual Studio 2015 or compatible Windows SDK installed.
The libs will compile with older compilers, but EasyRPG Player won't.

The powershell script (setup.ps1) requires execution permissions. Open a
powershell with admin permissions and run "set-executionpolicy remotesigned" once.

How to compile
==============

Run setup.ps1 from a powershell session. This downloads all required files and creates
visual studio projects suitable for compiling.

Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt (32 or 64bit) and execute "build TOOLSET"
Replace TOOLSET with one listed below (e.g. v140)
The only official supported toolset is v140, but others should work, too.

Compiler flags and requirements:
Release builds: /O2, /MD, /Zi and /arch:SSE2 enabled.
Debug builds: /MDd and /Zi enabled.
CPU requirements: Intel Pentium 4 or newer, AMD Athlon 64 or newer
OS requirements: Depending on the toolset, v140 needs Windows Vista SP1 or newer.

Common toolsets
===============

Command line arguments for the target toolset (assuming that the toolset is
installed):
v140 - Visual Studio 2015
v140_xp - Visual Studio 2015 with Windows XP support

After compiling
===============

The resulting files appear in build.

You must also set the environment variable EASYDEV_MSVC to the "build" folder
otherwise the EasyRPG project file can't find the libraries.
To create new environment variables enter the "Windows Control Panel" and
select "System" (or enter "environment variable" in the search field).
Sometimes new environment variables are not detected. Logout and -in again in
order to fix this.
