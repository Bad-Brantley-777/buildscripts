# EasyRPG buildscripts

The scripts used to compile needed libraries for supported platform ports
on our Jenkins CI server https://easy-rpg.org/jenkins/view/Toolchains/

## Notes

The Windows and Android scripts are self-contained, i.e. they work without
having the rest of this repository present.

The other platform scripts still need to be added.
