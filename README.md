# EasyRPG buildscripts

The scripts used to compile needed libraries for supported platform ports
on our Jenkins CI server https://easy-rpg.org/jenkins/view/Toolchains/

## Notes

The Windows, Android, Wii and Nintendo 3DS scripts are self-contained,
i.e. they work without having the rest of this repository present.

The other platform scripts still need to be added.
